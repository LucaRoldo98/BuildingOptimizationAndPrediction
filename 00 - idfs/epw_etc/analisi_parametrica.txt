#############Parametric analysis for U values:
We take our model and we modify the thickness of all the insulation materials checking some target parameters.
The target parameters are: DistrictHeating:Facility and DistrictCooling:Facility. Eventually also DistrictHeating:Facility



#############Parametric analysis for Shading:
When dealing with shading, in the IDF will appear a field "WindowShadingCOntrol" repeated many times, one per each zone where a shading is applied.
It appears like:

WindowShadingControl,
    1001-Block1:Zone3,       !- Name
    Block1:Zone3,            !- Zone Name
    1,                       !- Shading Control Sequence Number
    InteriorBlind,           !- Shading Type
    2001,                    !- Construction with Shading Name
    OnIfHighSolarOnWindow,   !- Shading Control Type
    Dwell_DomDining_Occ,     !- Schedule Name
    300,                     !- Setpoint {W/m2, W or deg C}
    Yes,                     !- Shading Control Is Scheduled
    No,                      !- Glare Control Is Active
    ,                        !- Shading Device Material Name
    FixedSlatAngle,          !- Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds
    ,                        !- Slat Angle Schedule Name
    0,                       !- Setpoint 2 {W/m2 or deg C}
    Block1:Zone3,            !- Daylighting Control Object Name
    Sequential,              !- Multiple Surface Control Type
    Block1:Zone3_Wall_5_0_0_0_0_0_Win,  !- Fenestration Surface 1 Name
    Block1:Zone3_Wall_6_0_0_0_0_0_Win;  !- Fenestration Surface 2 Name

We have to modify the shading control type and we can do it in different ways, depending on the requests (to check all the method, go on the documentation of e+ at page 377/378). For us
potentially the only useful are:
-OnIfHighSolarOnWindow
-OnIfHighOutdoorAirTemperature
-OnIfHighOutdoorAirTempAndHighSolarOnWindow => cool but I think it's slightly restrictive. The description on the documentation says: "Shading is on if the outside air temperature
exceeds the Setpoint (C) and if the solar radiation incident on the window exceeds SetPoint 2 (W/m2)" which basically is a AND operation, but we'd prefer to have an OR operation

Then for the setpoints we can modify Setpoint {W/m2, W or deg C} or/and Setpoint 2 {W/m2 or deg C} depending on the control strategy => check which are the best intervals
After the setup, repeat the simulation and extract again the same energy consumption parameters.
NOTA: it would be cool to do the multivariate analysis with shading and U values, but probably computationally expensive.

#############Parametric analysis for Natural Ventilation:
Regarding the natural ventilation, we have to check the fields of "ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate", looking like:

ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate,
    Block1:Zone3 Nat Vent,   !- Name
    Block1:Zone3,            !- Zone or ZoneList Name
    Dwell_DomDining_Occ,     !- Schedule Name
    Flow/zone,               !- Design Flow Rate Calculation Method
    .172359,                 !- Design Flow Rate {m3/s}
    ,                        !- Flow Rate per Zone Floor Area {m3/s-m2}
    ,                        !- Flow Rate per Person {m3/s-person}
    ,                        !- Air Changes per Hour {1/hr}
    NATURAL,                 !- Ventilation Type
    0,                       !- Fan Pressure Rise {Pa}
    1,                       !- Fan Total Efficiency
    1,                       !- Constant Term Coefficient
    0,                       !- Temperature Term Coefficient
    0,                       !- Velocity Term Coefficient
    0,                       !- Velocity Squared Term Coefficient
    20,                      !- Minimum Indoor Temperature {C}
    ,                        !- Minimum Indoor Temperature Schedule Name
    100,                     !- Maximum Indoor Temperature {C}
    ,                        !- Maximum Indoor Temperature Schedule Name
    0,                       !- Delta Temperature {deltaC}
    ,                        !- Delta Temperature Schedule Name
    20,                      !- Minimum Outdoor Temperature {C}
    ,                        !- Minimum Outdoor Temperature Schedule Name
    24,                      !- Maximum Outdoor Temperature {C}
    ,                        !- Maximum Outdoor Temperature Schedule Name
    40;                      !- Maximum Wind Speed {m/s}

Here there should be the set points and the ACH => Minimum Outdoor Temperature {C}, Maximum Outdoor Temperature {C}, Air Changes per Hour {1/hr}.
What we should check is the field "Design Flow Rate Calculation Method" and what type of method we should insert (All the methods can be found at page 650 of the e+ documentation).
By default the idf should be set on "Flow/zone", but there is the possibility to set "AirChanges/Hour"
